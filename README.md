The purpose of this project (description):

Hello! My name is Seth and I am a Computer Engineering undergraduate student attending Toronto Metropolitan University (currently First
Year on Winter Break). Always finding new, creative ways to earn money on the side, I have programmed a program that is able convert 
YouTube videos to .mp4 files with its maximum resolution within YouTube itself. I repurpose uploaded content and combine them to make
more YouTube content. The only issue is that I need to download the videos themselves. Simple solution to a simple problem, right? Just 
go on Google and use any of the online tools available. Well, no. Most of the websites I encounter are either ad-infested, require an 
account, contain potential malware, keep your uploaded files, abuse cookies, disable functionality due to an adblocker,... the list
goes on. I made this project to avoid all of these issues. Creating this project has proven to come with its various perks as well. 
This project gave me practice using Python and Git Bash (I hate command prompt), allowed me to integrate the features that mattered most
to me, and most importantly, gave me something to keep me busy. I will continue to update this project according to my personal needs,
as well as use it as a regular part of my content-creating day.
